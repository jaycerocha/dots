! Set Caps_Lock to Escape
! I tried to clear Lock and add Control_L everywhere in this
! file, but no way that caps stopped being caps. So annoying...
! but in the end I managed to make it work by calling xmodmap
! on the .xinitrc file.
keycode 66 = Control_L

! Space to Super_L (mod4)
remove mod4 = Super_L
keycode 65 = Super_L
keycode 250 = space
add mod4 = Super_L

! Tab to Mode_switch
keycode 108 = Mode_switch
keycode 252 = Alt_R
add mod3 = Mode_switch

! wasd to arrow keys
keycode 31 = i I Up Up
keycode 44 = j J Left Left
keycode 45 = k K Down Down
